It is in our best interest for this paper to be approachable as possible to any reader regarding their background.
	
	
	\section{Project Scope}
	The scope of this project is to create a web solution to our client needs some of them are a way to store customer data, appointment management and
	given the costumer to know when their upcoming appointment.
	having a concise DB is critical for this project and all the benefits derive from having a easy way to interact with this data.
	
	
	
	\chapter{Overall Description}
	
	\section{Product Perspective}
	This client doesn't have a easy way to interact with their data everything is being done by hand and paper. Is up to the appointed person to keep track of any appointment to every client.
	
	The client lacks a web page where we must provide an interactive  way for costumers to check their appointments prescriptions, and attract new ones. to simplifly workflow for the administrive personel and phisicians 
	
	
	\section{Product Functions}
	
	The key features of the product are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	Data Storage and retrieval: Our web app provides a secure and scalable way to store, organize, and retrieve valuable client data. It is easy to use and ensures data integrity and accessibility.
		\item	User Authentication: Protect sensitive data with user validation controls. Grant and manage access privileges to ensure that only authorized users can view, edit, or manipulate specific data sets.
		\item Automated Reminders: Generate custom remainders notifications for patients appointments.
		\item Integration: Seamlessly integrate with the Web application and services.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
	We identify three user classes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Patients should have to capability's of 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Check their respective data
			\item Schedule new appointments
			\item Receive information about appointments and prescriptions
		\end{itemize}
		\item Doctors can perform different task like
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Schedule appointments
			\item Retrieve patient data
			\item Make a prescription 
		\end{itemize}
		\item Administrative personnel
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Register new users
			\item View specific parts of the patient clinical history
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
This are the major groups identified, but i could be integrated another classes thanks to our self hosting solution and ease of management

	\subsection{Patients:}
	 The Patients table has a one-to-many relationship with the General Medical Records table. This means that a patient can have several general medical records.
	Physicians: The Physicians table has a one-to-many relationship with the Appointments table. This means that a physician can attend several appointments.
	
	\subsection{Appointments:}
	 The Appointments table has a one-to-one relationship with the Specific Medical Records table. This means that an appointment can have only one specific medical record.
	Hospitals: will store appointment addresses and doctors. 
	
	
	\section{Operating Environment}
	The system for the ophthalmology clinic is designed to operate within a specific operating environment that must meet a range of technical and software requirements to ensure efficient and reliable operation. Below are detailed key components and considerations of the operating environment:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Web server: The system utilizes a web server to provide access via a web browser. It can be deployed on common web servers such as Apache, Nginx, or other Python-compatible web servers like Flask or Django. The web server configuration should be appropriate to handle the expected traffic load, including multiple user requests, and ensure secure communication via HTTPS.
		
		\item Supported web Browsers: Users interact with the system through modern web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. The web application should be compatible with these platforms and popular browsers. The use of standard web technologies and web standards is recommended to ensure compatibility.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
	 Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
	developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
	limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
	applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
	operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
	considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
	customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
	software).
